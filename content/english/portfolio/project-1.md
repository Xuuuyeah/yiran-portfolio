An interactive data science project investigating the spatial and temporal distribution of the American Woodcock (*Scolopax minor*) — nicknamed the "timberdoodle" — across New York State using citizen science data from eBird.

#### Project Details

Analyzed eBird observational data spanning January 2019 to January 2024 to understand detection patterns and factors affecting woodcock encounters. The project includes data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and interactive visualizations including Leaflet maps showing observation distributions across New York.

Key variables examined include season, time of day, location type, and observer effort to identify optimal detection conditions for this declining shorebird species.

#### Conservation Significance

The American Woodcock serves as an umbrella species representing broader ecosystem health. By understanding where and when woodcocks are most likely to be detected, this analysis supports conservation planning and helps birders and researchers optimize survey efforts for this ecologically important species.
