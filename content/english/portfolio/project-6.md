Led a strategic analysis initiative at Charles River Laboratories to evaluate and drive the company's business transformation from traditional mouse models to next-generation gene-edited models — a critical pivot in the preclinical services industry.

---

#### Situation

The preclinical research market was undergoing a structural shift. Gene-edited animal models were rapidly gaining traction over traditional models due to superior translational relevance and regulatory preference. Charles River Laboratories, as a leading global Contract Research Organization (CRO), needed to assess the competitive landscape and determine how to position itself for this transition.

#### Task

I was tasked with delivering an end-to-end competitive intelligence analysis to inform the company's strategic roadmap:

- Map the competitive landscape across **42 industry players**, benchmarking business lines and core technologies
- Build a scalable data infrastructure to monitor clinical trial trends in real time
- Synthesize findings into an executive-ready strategic recommendation for senior leadership

#### Approach

**Competitive Landscape Mapping**
Conducted a comprehensive assessment of 42 competitors' business models, technology platforms, and market positioning by analyzing prospectuses, financial reports, and public disclosures. Structured the analysis around key dimensions: model portfolio breadth, therapeutic area focus, IP differentiation, and go-to-market strategy.

**Automated Market Intelligence Pipeline**
Designed and deployed an automated data pipeline using Python with CI/CD principles to scrape clinical trial data from public registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov). This enabled continuous monitoring of investment trends and clinical pipeline activity, replacing a previously manual and time-intensive process.

**Investment & Disease Area Prioritization**
Analyzed clinical trial pipeline data to identify high-potential therapeutic areas with strong growth trajectories. Evaluated disease-area attractiveness based on trial volume, funding trends, and competitive white space — delivering data-driven insights that directly informed R&D unit planning.

- **Differentiation Strategy → CEO Buy-in**: Synthesized findings into executive presentations and pitched a differentiation strategy directly to the CEO, projecting **10%+ market share capture** in the gene-edited model segment
- **R&D Expansion**: Analysis of clinical trial pipelines and investment trends directly contributed to the strategic decision to establish new **cardiovascular and metabolic R&D units**
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated data pipeline replaced manual competitor monitoring, enabling real-time market intelligence at scale
