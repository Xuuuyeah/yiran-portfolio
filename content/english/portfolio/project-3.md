**Recent insights into breast milk microRNA: their role as functional regulators**

A review article examining breast milk microRNAs (miRNAs) as regulatory molecules in infant development, published in *Frontiers in Nutrition* (April 2024).

#### Overview

Breast milk miRNAs survive harsh gastrointestinal conditions and can regulate gene expression after absorption by infants. This review synthesizes both *in vivo* and *in vitro* evidence supporting the functional hypothesis that milk-derived miRNAs act as active regulators — not merely nutritional components — with implications for infant immunity, development, and potential drug delivery applications.

#### Key Contributions

- Comprehensive survey of current methods in breast milk miRNA analysis (sequencing, qPCR, bioinformatics pipelines)
- Cross-species comparison of miRNA profiles in human, bovine, and porcine milk
- Mechanistic review of miRNA uptake, stability, and gene regulation in infant tissues
- Discussion of translational potential for miRNA-based therapeutics and biomarker discovery
