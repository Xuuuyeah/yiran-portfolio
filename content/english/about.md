I'm a master's student in Biostatistics at Columbia University with a background in data science, AI, and strategy-oriented consulting. I've worked on applying machine learning and analytics to real business problems, especially in healthcare, where translating complex data into clear decisions really matters.<br><br>My strength lies in bridging technical depth with business context—turning models into insights leaders can actually use. I enjoy cross-functional work and often take ownership of projects that sit between product, analytics, and strategy. Ultimately, I'm motivated by building data-driven solutions that create real impact rather than standalone technical wins.
